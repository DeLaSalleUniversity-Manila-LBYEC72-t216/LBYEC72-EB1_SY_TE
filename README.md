                                                   ----- UNIVERSITY PORTAL -----

      The purpose of this project is to make a university portal for the admin and students. It aims to make enrollment
      processes more convenient for the admin, as well as for the students. Admins can choose to add a course, remove a
      course, view courses, and save courses under the course offerings. On the other hand, students can choose to add 
      classes, remove classes, view their class schedules, and view the courses offered.
